  "project_name": "MultiAgent Tutor System",
  "Objective": " \n            The goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a multi-agent tutoring system where each AI model serves as a domain specific agent.\n            When a user poses a question, the agents engage in an internal dialogue sharing, debating, and refining ideas to collaboratively generate the most accurate and educationally effective response, \n            simulating the dynamics of a panel of expert tutors.\n            ",
  "Dataset": "\n            The dataset for fine-tuning and customization is still TBD. However, data will likely consist of relevant open-source academic texts,\n             dialogue datasets, and domain-specific content to build the required context for medical field perspectives.\n            ",
  "Rationale": "\n            Generative AI (genAI) technology offers a novel approach to supporting IPE given that routinely the diversity of team member participants is limited, and some fields are under-represented in IPE training but influential in \"real world\" teams. By using LLM-based chatbots for this educational\n             interventions, there is potential to both improve how learning experiences are delivered and  enhance student post-IPE performance . In this project, we will explore how an AI-driven team collaboration can  act as an educational \n             intervention.\n            ",
  "Approach": "\n            The project will proceed in several phases:\n            **Requirement Analysis**: Collaborate with lead researchers to define key components of IPE experiences and specify chatbot performance\n            requirements.\n            **Development**: Customize one or more open-source LLMs to create the initial version of the chatbot using RAG and fine-tuning methods.\n            **Validation**: Conduct multi-agent testing to evaluate the chatbot's performance across multiple medical/health domains and with varied inputs, focusing on \n            metrics such as adherence to guidelines, professional field representations, and ability to stay on topic.\n            **Usability Evaluation**: Perform usability testing with end users, including metrics for user satisfaction, ease of use, and learning outcomes.\n            **(Optional) Integration**: Develop LTI integration to connect the chatbot with existing LMS tools to ensure accessibility for students in course\n            environments.\n            ",
  "Timeline": "\n            This is a rough timeline for the project:\n             **Weeks 1-2**: Familiarization with project requirements, intellectual humility constructs, and open-source tools.\n             **Weeks 3-8**: Design, develop, and build a working prototype.\n             **Weeks 9-12**: Iterative testing and improvement of chatbot performance, incorporating feedback from simulated interactions.\n             **Weeks 13-16**: Multi-agent testing and usability evaluation.\n             **Weeks 17-18**: Final reporting, documentation, and presentation of outcomes.\n            ",
  "Expected Number Students": "\n            This project is suitable for a team of 2-3 students, given the scope and need for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n            ",
  "Possible Issues": "\n            Potential challenges for this project include:\n             **Limited Training Data**: Finding appropriate datasets for Retrieval-Augmented Generation or fine-tuning the LLM may be a limiting factor.\n             **Complexity of Interdisciplinary Teams**: Designing prompts and interactions to genuinely foster  collaborations of diverse teams, requiring careful iteration and feedback.\n             **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: This project spans multiple disciplines (e.g., Public Health, Medicine, Education, Data Science, Software Engineering), \n             requiring effective collaboration and understanding across fields.\n            ",
